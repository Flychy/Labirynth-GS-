# Labirynth-GS-
Labirynth solving problem with the implementation of Gauss Seidel algorithm

Our image represents a diagrame of a maze used in an laboratory experiment. More exactly the experiment begun by placing our animal (lets assume that is a mouse) at one of the fifteen interior intersections of the maze. Once the mouse emerges in the outer corridor it cannot return to the maze. When the mouse is at an interior intersection the path that he is going to choose is assumed to be random.
The program displays the probabilty of the mouse to emerge in the brown corridor by starting in any of those intersections.
